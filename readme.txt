== Description ==


The MediaBugs plugin for WordPress automatically adds a link to each post that allows users to file error reports about a blog's content to MediaBugs.org.

MediaBugs is a "bug tracker for news" -- a public, free, open-source service that tracks and tries to help resolve errors in media coverage. The MediaBugs WordPress plugin is intended for bloggers who are doing journalism on their sites.

With the plugin installed, site visitors will have one-click access to an error report form that appears as an overlay, pulls in the post's URL automatically, and files the error report to MediaBugs.org. Blog publishers can easily monitor MediaBugs for any error reports filed about their sites by subscribing to email alerts or RSS feeds.
